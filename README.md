# caesar_cipher
This is a cryptography tool used to encrypt and decrypt the message.The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. It's simply a type of substitution cipher. A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. It uses a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on.
